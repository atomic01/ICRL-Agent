# 🤖 ICRL-Agent
*A Deep Reinforcement Learning Agent with Intermittent Control for Autonomous Driving*

---

## 🧭 Overview
**ICRL-Agent** is a research project developed as part of my MSc thesis,  
**“Deep Learning Solutions for Autonomous Vehicles: Investigating the Impact of Intermittent Control on Reinforcement Learning.”**

The project explores how **intermittent control theory**, inspired by human decision-making and motor control, can improve the **stability**, **efficiency**, and **robustness** of deep reinforcement learning (RL) agents operating in autonomous driving environments.

Two main environments were used for experimentation:
- **CARLA Simulator** — realistic autonomous vehicle training setup.  
- **Custom Maze Solver** — simplified RL environment for controlled algorithmic testing.

## ⚙️ Methodology
The research investigates how introducing **decision intervals** (intermittent control) affects RL agent behavior.

**Key Steps:**
1. Implemented **Deep Q-Networks (DQN)** with discrete control timing.  
2. Integrated **intermittent control logic** to simulate human-like reaction delays.  
3. Trained and compared **continuous vs. intermittent** control policies.  
4. Evaluated metrics focused on **training efficiency** rather than control accuracy,  
   including:
   - **Convergence speed** — time required to reach reward stabilization.  
   - **Sample efficiency** — number of episodes needed for consistent performance.  
   - **Computation cost** — training time per episode and overall runtime.  
   - **Stability under intermittent updates** — observing variance in learning curves.

## 🧪 Notes
The experiments demonstrated that intermittent control can reduce the overall training
time required for convergence while maintaining comparable reward performance to
continuously controlled agents — suggesting a potential improvement in computational
efficiency for resource-constrained RL systems.

- Designed for **academic research** and proof-of-concept evaluation.  
- Code focuses on demonstrating behavior differences, not production optimization.  
- Results may vary depending on **TensorFlow/PyTorch** and **CARLA** versions.
