**Deep Learning Solutions for Autonomous Vehicles – Intermittent Control in Reinforcement Learning**

## Overview  
This repository contains supplementary materials, code, and experimental artifacts developed as part of the MSc thesis **“Deep Learning Solutions for Autonomous Vehicles”**.  
The research investigates how **intermittent control theory** can influence the stability and learning efficiency of **deep reinforcement learning agents** within the **CARLA simulator** environment.

The work focuses on understanding and implementing control behaviors in simulated autonomous driving tasks, comparing continuous and intermittent control mechanisms through neural network–based agents.

## Repository Structure  


## Key Files and Modules  
- **`final_version_carla_DQN_with_IC.py`** — DQN implementation integrated with intermittent control.  
- **`final_version_maze_DQN_with_IC.py`** — DQN variant for testing intermittent control in a maze environment.  
- **Notebooks** (e.g., *notebook 3*, *notebook 3.1*) — contain logs, analysis, and result visualizations for experiments.  

## Notes  
- The implementations are **research-oriented** and focus on demonstrating intermittent control concepts rather than achieving production-grade optimization.  
- Some experimental results may vary depending on CARLA and TensorFlow/PyTorch versions.  
- This repository serves as supporting material for the written MSc thesis submitted to **Manchester Metropolitan University (2020)**.
